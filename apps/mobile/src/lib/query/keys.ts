/**
 * Merkezi query key registry — TanStack Query anahtarlarının TEK kaynağı.
 *
 * Neden: 189 inline useQuery ekranlar arası anahtarları elle yazıyordu
 * (`['my-collections']` vs `['myCollections']`, `['collections']` vs
 * `['collection', id]` gibi sessiz drift'ler). Merkezî factory ile:
 *   - anahtarlar tutarlı ve tip-güvenli üretilir,
 *   - mutation hook'ları `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: qk.products.all })`
 *     ile bir domain'in tüm alt-anahtarlarını hiyerarşik geçersiz kılar.
 *
 * Konvansiyon (web `lib/queryClient` ergonomisinin mobil karşılığı):
 *   qk.<domain>.all                 → domain kökü (liste invalidasyonu için)
 *   qk.<domain>.list(filters?)      → filtreli/aramalı liste
 *   qk.<domain>.detail(id)          → tekil kayıt
 *
 * Yeni domain eklerken: aşağıya bir factory nesnesi ekle, `as const` bırak.
 * Ekranlar Faz 1'de inline anahtarlarını bu registry'ye bağlar.
